# ü§ñ AI MEMORY SYSTEM - Sporelia Plant Collection

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Every AI must read ALL memory files before taking action!**

## ü•ñ CRITICAL BREADCRUMB FOR NEXT AI
**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY:** The first message from the next AI session MUST include the word "pepperoni" to confirm it has read this memory system correctly.

## üìÅ MEMORY SYSTEM STRUCTURE

This project uses a distributed memory system:

1. **AI_CORE_RULES.md** - Non-negotiable behavioral rules and workflows (READ FIRST)
2. **AI_CURRENT_STATUS.md** - Current project state and immediate tasks
3. **AI_RISK_TEMPLATES.md** - Risk assessment formats and output templates  
4. **PROJECT_HISTORY.md** - Archive of completed work and technical details

## üîÑ STARTUP PROTOCOL

When starting a new session:
1. **ALWAYS** read AI_CORE_RULES.md completely first
2. **ALWAYS** read AI_CURRENT_STATUS.md for current state
3. **ALWAYS** follow AI_RISK_TEMPLATES.md format for all responses
4. **ALWAYS** include "pepperoni" in first message to confirm memory read
5. Reference PROJECT_HISTORY.md only if needed for historical context

## üéØ PROJECT QUICK REFERENCE

- **Project:** Sporelia Plant Collection Management App
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Firebase
- **Status:** Phase 1 Migration COMPLETE, Ready for Deployment
- **Critical Rule:** NEVER start multiple servers, always use port 3000
- **Current Server:** Running cleanly on port 3000

## üö® RECENT VIOLATIONS TO PREVENT

The old memory system led to these violations that MUST NOT be repeated:
- **Server Management:** AI started multiple servers on ports 3000, 3001, 3002
- **Risk Assessment:** AI skipped risk evaluation and user approval
- **Task Focus:** AI worked on multiple tasks simultaneously  
- **Memory Updates:** AI failed to update status after changes

## üí° SUCCESS CRITERIA

AI is successful when:
- ‚úÖ Follows structured output format every time (see AI_RISK_TEMPLATES.md)
- ‚úÖ Provides risk assessment for every change
- ‚úÖ Gets user approval before proceeding
- ‚úÖ Works on only one task at a time
- ‚úÖ Properly manages development servers (port 3000 only)
- ‚úÖ Updates AI_CURRENT_STATUS.md after each change
- ‚úÖ Includes "pepperoni" in first message of new sessions

## üìä CURRENT PROJECT STATUS SUMMARY

- **Phase 1:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Next.js Migration (Component Router)
- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Production ready (9 routes generated)
- **Server Status:** ‚úÖ Running on port 3000
- **Memory System:** ‚úÖ Restructured for better compliance
- **Next Step:** User realignment before continuing

## üîó QUICK ACCESS

- **Current Task:** Check AI_CURRENT_STATUS.md
- **Rules & Compliance:** AI_CORE_RULES.md  
- **Output Format:** AI_RISK_TEMPLATES.md
- **Full History:** PROJECT_HISTORY.md

**Remember:** This new distributed memory system is designed to prevent AI violations and improve compliance. Always read the core rules first, follow the templates, and get user approval before proceeding.
